# Graph Neural Networks for Street-Level House Price Prediction

A Rust implementation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for urban house price prediction, based on the research approach described in "Cities as Graphs". This project demonstrates how street networks can be modeled as graphs and analyzed using machine learning for urban planning and economic applications.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This implementation uses the [Burn](https://burn.dev/) machine learning framework with WGPU backend for GPU acceleration. The core components include:

### 1. Graph Representation (`src/graph.rs`)
- **Nodes**: Street segments with urban features (building characteristics, land use, etc.)
- **Edges**: Physical connections between streets
- **Features**: 16-dimensional feature vectors per node including:
  - Year built, building area, number of floors
  - Commercial/residential/industrial area ratios
  - Lot dimensions and characteristics



### 2. Graph Convolutional Layers
- Implements the GCN approach from Kipf & Welling (2017)
- Message passing between neighboring street segments
- Multiple hidden layers for learning complex urban patterns

### 3. Node Classification
- Predicts house price categories (5 classes from Low to High)
- Uses softmax output for probability distributions
- Includes autodiff support for training



## üéØ Key Features

- **Street Network Modeling**: Represents urban areas as graphs where streets are nodes
- **Neighborhood Learning**: GNN layers allow each street to learn from its connected neighbors
- **Urban Feature Integration**: Incorporates multiple urban characteristics per street segment
- **GPU Acceleration**: Uses WGPU backend for efficient tensor operations
- **Autodiff Support**: Full backward pass implementation for training

## üöÄ Usage

Run the demonstration:

```bash
cargo run --bin run --release
```

This will execute three main demonstrations:

1. **GNN Inference Demo**: Shows predictions for a sample 6-street network
2. **GNN Autodiff Demo**: Demonstrates forward and backward passes
3. **Original Kernel Demo**: Compares custom vs reference implementations


## üìä Sample Output

Sample Street Network Topology:
Street 0 <-> Street 1, Street 2
Street 1 <-> Street 0, Street 2, Street 3
Street 2 <-> Street 0, Street 1, Street 3, Street 4 (central hub)
Street 3 <-> Street 1, Street 2, Street 4, Street 5
Street 4 <-> Street 2, Street 3, Street 5
Street 5 <-> Street 3, Street 4

Ground Truth Labels:
Street 0: Low-Med (category 1)
Street 1: Medium (category 2)  
Street 2: High (category 4)
Street 3: Low (category 0)
Street 4: Low-Med (category 1)
Street 5: Medium (category 2)

## üß† Research Background

This implementation is based on the research paper's key insights:

### Problem Statement
Traditional house price prediction models treat properties in isolation, missing the crucial spatial relationships that determine value. The "neighborhood effect" is difficult to quantify using conventional approaches.

### GNN Solution
Graph Neural Networks can naturally model:
- **Spatial Relationships**: Direct encoding of street connectivity
- **Neighborhood Effects**: Message passing allows distant streets to influence predictions
- **Urban Features**: Rich node features capture local characteristics
- **Scalability**: Can handle city-scale networks efficiently

### Mathematical Foundation
The core GCN layer implements:
```
H^(l+1) = œÉ(√Ç * H^(l) * W^(l))
```
where:
- `√Ç` is the normalized adjacency matrix (street connections)
- `H^(l)` are node features at layer l
- `W^(l)` are learnable parameters
- `œÉ` is an activation function (ReLU)


## üèôÔ∏è Real-World Applications

This approach could be extended for:

1. **Urban Planning**: Identify undervalued neighborhoods for development
2. **Investment Analysis**: Predict areas with growth potential
3. **Policy Impact**: Model how infrastructure changes affect property values
4. **Market Analysis**: Understand spatial patterns in housing markets
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify areas vulnerable to price volatility

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Graph Construction
- Sample network represents a small neighborhood with 6 intersecting streets
- Adjacency matrix encodes physical street connections
- Self-loops added for GCN normalization

### Feature Engineering
Each street node includes:
- **Temporal**: Year built, time since refurbishment
- **Physical**: Building dimensions, floor area ratios
- **Functional**: Land use mix (residential/commercial/industrial)
- **Spatial**: Lot characteristics and frontage
